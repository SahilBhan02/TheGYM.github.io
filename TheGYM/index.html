But with hard work, with belief, with confidence and trust in yourself and those around you, there are no limits.I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.If you persevere long enough, if you do the right things long enough, the right things will happen.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">We all know that exercise is important in our daily lives, but we may not know why or what exercise can do for us.

            It’s important to remember that we have evolved from nomadic ancestors who spent all their time moving around in search of food and shelter, travelling large distances on a daily basis. Our bodies are designed and have evolved to be regularly active.
            
            In the same way that a sports car is designed to go fast, we are designed to move. If the sports car is taken out once a week for a 3 mile round trip through a town centre then it would probably develop engine problems fairly quickly.
            
            Over time people too develop problems if they sit down all day at a desk or in front of the TV and minimise the amount of exercise they do.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The art of practicing yoga helps in controlling an individual's mind, body and soul. It brings together physical and mental disciplines to achieve a peaceful body and mind; it helps manage stress and anxiety and keeps you relaxing. It also helps in increasing flexibility, muscle strength and body tone</p>
